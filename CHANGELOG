~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added checkout from github instead of copying files over

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added support to automatically pull the latest version of plugins from api.wordpress.org then from there update plugins accordingly - note its not possible to grab versions and check to update, we actually have to pull the zip and update each time. Little less efficient but it works. Will work on another solution later.
* added better handling if a plugin wasn't found, it would let you know that its no longer in the wordpress repository

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* added a config file with option to specify multiple wordpress installations
* fixed a path typo for wp-content
* major rewrite, no longer downloads the file each night and does hash comparisons, it pulls from wordpress' api then does a match under wp-includes/versions.php - much more efficient and don't need to maintain a working copy
* rewrote it so that it only downloads latest.zip once if needed
* added ability to specify multiple wordpress installations and as many as you want

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* initial release of wpupdate
